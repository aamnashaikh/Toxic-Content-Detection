# Toxic Content Detection

## Project Description
This project focuses on detecting toxic or abusive content in text using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The system analyzes textual data and classifies it as toxic or non-toxic based on learned patterns from labeled datasets.

The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) and is suitable for academic and learning purposes.

---

## Objectives
- To preprocess and clean textual data
- To analyze toxic language patterns
- To train a machine learning model for text classification
- To evaluate the model’s performance on unseen data

---

## Technologies & Tools Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)

---

## Dataset
The dataset consists of text samples labeled as toxic or non-toxic.  
The notebook supports:
- Direct file upload (Google Colab)
- Loading data from Google Drive

⚠️ Dataset files are not included for privacy and size reasons.
